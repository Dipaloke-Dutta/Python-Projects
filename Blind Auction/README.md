_**The blind auction rules:**_

->Each bidder privately enters their name and bid amount.
->Bids are secret; no bidder knows others' bids.
->After every bid, the program asks if there are more bidders.
->If yes, the screen clears to keep bids hidden.
->If no, bidding ends, and the highest bid wins.
->The winner and their bid are announced at the end.

**This is a sealed-bid (blind) auction where everyone submits one bid without seeing others' offers, and the highest bidder wins.**
